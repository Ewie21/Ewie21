## Hi, I'm Azalea
- I enjoy learning more about programming, sociology, political science, and philosophy.
- I can program in Rust, C, Java, Python, and TypeScript; SQL is tolerated.
- Application Software Manager on the [Catlin Gabel FRC team](https://www.team1540.org/)
- I’m currently working on [floralcc](https://github.com/Ewie21/floralcc), just for fun
